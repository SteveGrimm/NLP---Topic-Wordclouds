# NLP - Topic Wordclouds

Using NLP Tasks to generate Topic models and Wordclouds, we create Wordtags for Podcasts to help categorize their content. Including client presentation.

The models includes the use of:

* LDA (Topic Modelling)
* Wordcloud (Visualization)

and the following libraries:

* Gensim (Natural Language Processing)
* pyLDAvis (Topic Modelling)
* wordcloud

Resulting tags resemble the summaries of the podcasts quite well, as can be seen in the presentation.
